# Formatting

macOS ships two module-agnostic drivers, `/sbin/newfs_fskit` and
`/sbin/fsck_fskit`, which dispatch to an FSKit module by name. Conforming to
`FSManageableResourceMaintenanceOperations` is all it takes to be reachable
from them:

```bash
newfs_fskit -t ext4 -L MYDISK /dev/disk5
newfs_fskit -t ext4 -g 3 -b 1024 /dev/disk5     # ext3, 1 KiB blocks
fsck_fskit  -t ext4 /dev/disk5
```

`-t` selects the *module*, by its `FSShortName` — not a personality — so which
of ext2/ext3/ext4 to create is `-g`. The options are declared in `Info.plist`
under `FSFormatOptionSyntax` (`g:b:L:I:N:J:n`) and `FSCheckOptionSyntax` (`n`);
FSKit parses them with getopt before the module sees them.

Formatting clears any previous filesystem's signatures first — 64 KiB of
zeroes over each end of the partition, inside `ext4b_format` itself, since
ext4 never touches the boot area where FAT/exFAT/NTFS keep their magic and a
surviving boot sector would win the next probe. (FSKit's `wipeResource` was
tried and is unreachable from a CLI-initiated format.) Then it builds the
volume.
Each volume gets a fresh random UUID — lwext4's `mkfs` copies whatever UUID it
is handed straight into the superblock and never generates one, so every
volume would otherwise be all-zero and indistinguishable to DiskArbitration.

## What the volumes look like

lwext4's `mkfs` is conservative. Compared with `mke2fs` it omits `ext_attr`,
`resize_inode`, `metadata_csum`, `64bit`, `flex_bg`, `dir_nlink`, `extra_isize`
and `huge_file`, producing:

```
has_journal dir_index filetype extent sparse_super large_file
```

That is a valid ext4 the Linux kernel mounts without complaint, but it has **no
metadata checksums**, so it is less able to detect corruption than a volume
`mke2fs` would create. Anyone with `mke2fs` available is better off using it;
this exists so that a Mac with no e2fsprogs installed can still make a volume.

The lack of `64bit` also caps a volume at 2³² blocks — 16 TiB at the default
4 KiB block size, which is `FSFormatMaximumSize` in the personality.

## `startCheck` is a mountability check, not `fsck`

It parses the superblock, applies the feature gate, verifies the checksum seed
still matches the UUID, and replays a dirty journal. It does **not** walk the
inode table, cross-check bitmaps against extent trees, or repair anything —
lwext4 has no fsck. A volume that passes can still be corrupt in ways only
`e2fsck` will find, and the operation says so in its own output.
