# lwext4 patches

Applied automatically by the build (`make patch`, and as a prerequisite of every
object file). Idempotent — a clean checkout builds with a plain `make`.

| Patch | What it does |
|---|---|
| `0001-guard-EXT_FINCOM_IGNORED` | Lets the build extend the INCOMPAT bits lwext4 tolerates, so we can accept `metadata_csum_seed` (which modern `mke2fs` enables by default) after the bridge has verified the seed still matches the UUID. |
| `0002-fix-xattr-remove-ibody-finder` | **Bug fix.** NULL dereference (SIGSEGV) when removing an xattr stored in the inode body — the common case. |
| `0003-avoid-null-pointer-arithmetic-in-xattr-list` | Replaces a `sizeof`-via-null-pointer idiom that UBSan flags on every `listxattr`. |
| `0004-fix-htree-leaf-block-init-and-checksum-order` | **Bug fix.** New HTree leaf blocks were never cleared (stale buffer contents written into a directory block) and were checksummed before the last field was written, so `e2fsck` reported `directory passes checks but fails checksum`. |
| `0005-keep-journal-sequence-monotonic-across-mounts` | **Bug fix, data loss.** `jbd_journal_stop()` reset the on-disk journal sequence to 0, so every session restarted at 1 and stale log records from an earlier session were indistinguishable from current ones. A crash in the window after the journal superblock is published but before the transaction commits let recovery replay **old metadata over the live filesystem**. |

0002, 0004 and 0005 are genuine upstream defects and are worth sending
upstream. 0002 and 0004 were found by running the write suite under
`-fsanitize=address,undefined` (`make test-asan`); 0005 was found by the
crash-consistency sweep.

0005 is the most serious of the three. It is invisible to any test that does
not actually sever the write stream, because in normal operation the journal is
written, committed and checkpointed without ever being replayed. It only bites
on the recovery path — which is the one path that exists specifically to
protect data.

0004 is a good illustration of why the suite runs `e2fsck` after *every*
operation and why it runs under sanitizers: in an ordinary optimised build the
bug is invisible, because the freshly-allocated block happens to be zeroed and
the stale checksum still matches.
